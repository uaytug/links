## Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps to update a website to address issues with the main page and responsiveness, and to add support for web3 technologies.

## Step 1: Address the main page issues

1. Conduct a user experience (UX) review of the website to identify areas for improvement.
2. Develop a new design for the main page that incorporates necessary information and improves user engagement.
3. Implement the new design using responsive web design techniques to ensure compatibility with all devices, including foldable phones.

## Step 2: Fix responsive issues with foldable phones

1. Conduct thorough testing of the website on foldable phones to identify specific issues.
2. Apply appropriate CSS and JavaScript techniques to ensure the website displays correctly on foldable phones.

## Step 3: Add web3 support

1. Familiarize yourself with web3 technologies and how they can be integrated into a website.
2. Determine which web3 features are most relevant for your website and audience, such as blockchain-based identity verification or decentralized payment systems.
3. Integrate the selected web3 features into the website, ensuring they are user-friendly and easy to use.

## Step 4: Test and launch

1. Conduct thorough testing of the updated website to ensure it functions correctly and is fully compatible with all devices and browsers.
2. Launch the updated website, incorporating user feedback and making any necessary adjustments based on feedback.

Remember to document all changes made during the website update process, including any web3 integrations, to ensure that the website can be easily maintained and updated in the future.
